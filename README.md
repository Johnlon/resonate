# Resonate

**An open, community-owned loudspeaker enclosure simulator that runs in any browser.**

*Speaker design belongs to everyone who builds.*

Resonate is a modern, free, open-source replacement for WinISD — a tool to design
sealed, vented, bandpass, and passive-radiator enclosures from a driver's
Thiele/Small parameters. No install, no licence key, runs on a phone. One HTML
file. Validated against the closed-form physics, with a self-test that proves it
on every load.

## Why

The speaker-design tool landscape is a graveyard. WinISD has been abandoned since
2016 and is Windows-only. Basta, Unibox, the old spreadsheets — fragmented and
dead. The web calculators that filled the gap mostly can't be trusted at the
frequencies that matter.

The Thiele/Small math has been public since the 1970s. The knowledge is open; the
tools are not. Resonate exists to close that gap, and to do it **once, together**,
instead of as another solo project that dies in a year.

## What it does

- **Box types:** sealed, vented (bass-reflex), 4th-order bandpass, passive radiator
- **Curves:** SPL, driver + PR cone excursion, port air velocity, group delay,
  impedance magnitude & phase, transfer-function phase, max SPL, max power
- **Design aids:** EBP box-type gauge, Qtc / QB3-B4 alignment helpers, vent
  length ↔ tuning solver, passive-radiator Fp tuning + mass auto-tune,
  multiple drivers (series / parallel)
- **Files:** import **and** export WinISD `.wdr` driver files; save/load whole
  projects as JSON

## Trust, not vibes

Every model is validated against the exact closed-form solutions:

- the sealed box reproduces `fc = Fs·√(1+Vas/Vb)`, `Qtc = Qts·√(1+Vas/Vb)` to
  **< 0.03 dB**
- the passband asymptotes to the driver's reference sensitivity
- the vented box rolls off at 24 dB/oct with two impedance peaks straddling Fb

The app runs these as a self-test in your browser console on load, and they run in
CI from `test/engine.test.mjs`. If the physics is wrong, the test goes red — in
public. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the model.

## Run it

It's a single static file. Any of these work:

- **Hosted:** <https://johnlon.github.io/resonate/> — nothing to install, or
- **Offline:** download `index.html` and open it directly in a browser, or
- **Local server:** `python -m http.server` then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

No build step, no dependencies, no toolchain.

## Driver library

`drivers/` holds community-contributed `.wdr` files. Got a driver Resonate
doesn't? Import its spec sheet, check the numbers, and open a PR with the `.wdr`.
Every spec sheet added is a gift to the next builder — this shared library is the
whole point.

## Contributing

Newcomers welcome — you do not need to be an acoustician. The engine is plain
JavaScript in one file with no build step; a new box type or filter is a weekend
and a pull request. Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## License

MIT — forever. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). Resonate can never be closed up, taken
away, or left behind a login. If the maintainers vanish, fork it and carry on.
