# Resonate — feature backlog

Working list of capabilities that make Resonate a complete, professional
enclosure-design tool. Items are described on their own terms; each notes how it
fits the existing engine so it can become a GitHub issue. Priorities are a guide,
not a contract — pick what interests you and open a PR.

**P0** = foundation, gates everything below · **P1** = high value, tractable on
today's engine · **P2** = larger but well-defined · **P3** = big rocks (design first).

## P0 — Test & architecture foundation  *(do this before more features)*

Resonate is a spike: logic is one inline script in `index.html`, "verified" by a
self-test that string-slices the engine out and `eval`s it, with no real UI tests.
The aim: a decoupled, fully-tested core library that any UI (web, mobile,
third-party) can build on. **Full plan: [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md)** ·
practices: [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) · oracles:
[docs/REFERENCES.md](docs/REFERENCES.md). **Feature work is gated on this.**

- [ ] **P0 · Phase 0** Golden-master fixtures: freeze current sweep outputs for
      every box type, assert equality — the net that proves extraction preserves
      behaviour, before any code moves.
- [ ] **P0 · Phase 1** Extract the core (`complex`, `driver`, `wdr`, `circuit`,
      `sweep`, `alignments`, `state`) into `src/core/*.js` — no DOM — one module
      at a time, **extracting not rewriting**, with the dual export (classic
      `<script src>` + `module.exports`). Go/no-go after each: opens from
      `file://` **and** `node --test` requires it.
- [ ] **P0 · Phase 2** Define & version the `Design → Curves` contract
      (`docs/CONTRACT.md`) — the documented API third-party UIs depend on.
- [ ] **P0 · Phase 3** Per-module functional tests vs tiered oracles (closed
      forms > datasheets > alignment tables > cross-tool); retire the string-slice
      hack. Verify alignment-table numbers against a primary source first.
- [ ] **P0 · Phase 4** Rebuild the Resonate UI on the core contract only.
- [ ] **P0 · Phase 5** Playwright functional tests + CI runs unit + golden +
      functional on every push / PR.
- [ ] **Research** Chrome's MCP server as a functional-test driver — evaluate vs
      Playwright for driving the real app and checking rendered canvases.
- [ ] **P1 · Phase 6** Mobile / responsive (PWA) UI as a second consumer of the
      core — proves the decoupling; deferred, not part of the foundation.
- [ ] **P1** Error visibility sized to a static client tool: global error
      boundary + a debug-log toggle (not an observability stack).
- [x] **P0** Persist design across reloads (ctrl-R keeps the driver) — localStorage
- [x] **P0** Power input convention: primary input is **power (W)**, voltage derived

## Signal chain & EQ  *(the curves are already complex — filters slot in cleanly)*
- [ ] **P1** Parametric (peaking) EQ — fc, Q, gain; multiple bands; applied to the transfer function

- [ ] **P1** Configurable listening distance (replace the fixed 1 m)
- [ ] **P1** Frequency-range presets (sub / woofer / wide / custom) for the plot range

      ProjectInfo, Driver, Box, Vent*, PassiveRadiator, SignalSource, Filters)
- [ ] **P2** Unibox spreadsheet import

      selection, comparisons) lives in a shareable link; no server needed
- [x] **P1** Export / import the complete design as a JSON file
- [ ] **P2** Optional Google Drive storage — let users save and open designs in
      their *own* Google Drive. Keeps personal storage entirely on the user's
      side with no server or accounts on ours (opt-in; nothing stored unless the
      user chooses it)
