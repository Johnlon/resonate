# WDR Schema

**Authoritative reference for the WDR file format and the `_meta.yml` provenance sidecar.**

## 1. File format

`.wdr` is WinISD Pro's driver file format. It is a plain-text INI-style file.

| Property            | Value                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Section header      | `[Driver]` — must be the first line; no other sections                                                                                                                     |
| Field separator     | `=` with no spaces (`Key=Value`)                                                                                                                                           |
| Decimal separator   | `.` (period)                                                                                                                                                               |
| Encoding            | UTF-8 (⚠ assumption — not directly verified from WinISD source code)                                                                                                       |
| Line endings        | CRLF (⚠ assumption — Windows application)                                                                                                                                  |
| Field order         | **Observed consistent** across 423 `drivers/matt/` files and 53 WinISD-generated probe files — whether WinISD enforces order on read is untested                           |
| Total native fields | 56 (7 metadata + 48 numeric/string + 1 ParState) — WinISD always writes all 56 on save; scraper-generated files may have only 27–29 (core T/S block) and WinISD loads them |
| Custom fields       | Observed after `ParState=` only — not verified that WinISD ignores pre-ParState unknowns                                                                                   |

WDR files contain only WinISD-native fields. All provenance and quality metadata lives in
the companion `_meta.yml` sidecar (see §9).

## 2. Canonical field order

All 423 `drivers/matt/` files and all 53 WinISD probe files use this order — observed universally consistent. WinISD always writes in this order on save. Whether it enforces order on read is untested; because WinISD loads short-format files (27–29 fields) correctly, it likely reads by key name.

| DateModified | string | YYYYMMDD | Date of last refresh; no separators. Updated by scrapers on each run.                              |

### 3.2 T/S parameters (positions 8–25)

All user-entered in the WinISD UI. Units are SI throughout — see §6 for conversion factors.

| Field | Unit    | Description and key notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Qts   | —       | Total damping. Qts = (Qms × Qes)/(Qms + Qes). **Do not enter Qts manually when Qms and Qes are both present** — write Qts=C in ParState and let WinISD compute it. See §5.1.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Znom  | Ω       | Nominal impedance. **Descriptive only — not used in WinISD simulation.** Source: thielesmall.html. Always enter explicitly; WinISD sometimes assumes the wrong value.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Fs    | Hz      | **Mandatory for woofers and midranges.** Free-air resonance frequency. AMT tweeters and compression drivers may legitimately omit Fs — the schema does not require it; the scraper must log its absence as a problem for human review.                                                                                                                 |
| Pe    | W       | Thermal limited max. continuous power handling. If driven above Pe continuously, driver will fail.

| SPL   | dB/W/1m | Power sensitivity. `0` if not set. If user enters SPL → ParState pos 4 = E. If WinISD computes it internally → stores the computed value with pos 4 = C.

| fLe   | Hz      | Frequency at which Le and KLe were measured. `0` = use standard Le model only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| KLe   | H·√Hz   | Voice coil semi-inductance (Vanderkooy model). `0` = model not active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| BL    | T·m     | Force factor. **Case-sensitive: `BL=` not `Bl=`** — WinISD imports `BL=` only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Xmax  | m       | **One-way PEAK linear excursion in metres.** Not RMS, not peak-to-peak. WinISD uses the raw value — no correction factors applied (some references multiply by 1.15 or 0.87; WinISD does not). Some manufacturers publish the damage limit (Xlim) instead of the linear limit — always use the linear limit. Source: thielesmall.html, plottypes.html. |
| Cms   | m/N     | Mechanical compliance (inverse of stiffness). Most dangerous unit — SB Acoustics doesn't list Cms; Tang Band uses μm/N (÷1,000,000).                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Qms   | —       | Mechanical Q. Higher Qms = less mechanical damping = sharper resonance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Qes   | —       | Electrical Q. Higher Qes = less electromagnetic damping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Project rule for scrapers:** Write `VCCon=1`. This matches what WinISD natively writes and is correct for all single-VC drivers.

### 3.6 Environmental constants (positions 46–47)

Present in all 423 `drivers/matt/` files. WinISD stores them for simulation reproducibility —
SPL and efficiency depend on air properties. **Do not omit these fields.**

Values vary slightly across files because they reflect the WinISD environment settings
(temperature/pressure) at the time of saving. The most common values:

| roo   | kg/m³ | `1.20095217714682` | Air density at ~20°C, 1 atm. Other observed: `1.20095`, `1.20096171470853`  |

Source: plottypes.html — "Because driver's efficiency is related to ambient conditions,
changing for example the project's temperature, will change the calculated SPL level."

### 3.7 Physical dimensions (positions 48–55)

User-entered on the WinISD Dimensions tab. Not derived from T/S parameters. Dimension data appears as text in some datasheets and as engineering drawings or images in most — scrapers currently write `0` because this data is not yet extracted. DVol is computed by WinISD from the other dimension fields.

### 3.8 Parameter state (position 56)

See §8 for the complete ParState specification.

## 4. Consistency-check groups

Source: 15 groups confirmed from winisd.exe binary ASCII strings at offset ~8894, immediately
preceding the `TfrmParErrors` form definition; the remaining 7 are inferred from WinISD's
dependency structure and observed behaviour. Group 18 is explicitly ⚠ inferred.

Note: the binary uses field name variants that differ from WDR keys — `Bl` vs `BL`,
`fs` vs `Fs`, `Gamma` vs `gamma`. The WDR field name is what matters for file format;
the binary name is the source of evidence.

**`TfrmParErrors` trigger — empirically unresolved (2026-06-28):** The dialog "Parameter
error list" / "Consistency check on following parameter groups failed." exists in the binary
but was never observed firing in direct testing: loading files with deliberate inconsistencies
produced no warning, saving produced no warning, and WinISD has no menu option to trigger a
manual check. WinISD resolves inconsistencies via the C/E mode system (see §5.1) rather than
warnings. These groups document WinISD's internal parameter dependency graph — which fields
it treats as computable from which others — not a runtime validation dialog.

## 5. Constraints and rules

### 5.1 Qts consistency

`Qts = (Qms × Qes) / (Qms + Qes)`

WinISD manages Qts via the C/E mode system — empirically verified 2026-06-28 using
`drivers/sample/inconsistency-test*.wdr`:

| Qts ParState         | Behaviour                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C or N (not entered) | Recalculates Qts **live and instantly** as Qms or Qes change; also written correctly on save |
| E (user entered)     | Qts is pinned — changing Qms or Qes has no effect; no warning issued                         |

Some forum posts suggest WinISD shows a consistency-check warning for mismatched Qts/Qms/Qes — this does not occur in practice (human-tested 2026-06-28). See §4 for how WinISD actually handles parameter dependencies.

**Reverting a pinned Qts:** if the user has typed Qts (making it E/green), they can revert
it to calculated by selecting the field and pressing Delete — WinISD immediately recalculates
Qts from Qms/Qes and marks it C. Confirmed 2026-06-28.

Source: direct WinISD 0.7.0.950 testing 2026-06-28.

### 5.2 Field order

All 56 native fields must appear in the canonical order from §2. Do not reorder, skip, or
insert extra fields within the native block. WinISD likely parses by position/sequence.

### 5.3 ParState placement

`ParState=` must be the last native WinISD field. Confirmed across all 423 `drivers/matt/` files — no WinISD-native fields appear after `ParState=`.

### 5.4 c and roo

`c=343.684120962152` (m/s) and `roo=1.20095217714682` (kg/m³) — WinISD environment constants
at ~20°C, 1 atm — must be present in every WDR file. WinISD uses these for SPL calculation;
their absence may cause WinISD to apply different defaults.

## 6. Unit conventions

All WDR fields use SI units — the canonical unit for each field is in §3. Scrapers
must convert from datasheet units before writing. See `drivers/SCRAPING_RULES.md` for
the full conversion table and per-manufacturer Xmax conventions.

## 7. Common mistakes

| Wrong                        | Correct                                     | Why                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Z=8`                        | `Znom=8`                                    | WinISD uses `Znom=`; `Z=` is silently ignored                                                  |
| `Bl=7.5`                     | `BL=7.5`                                    | Case-sensitive; `Bl=` is not imported                                                          |
| `Name=foo`                   | `Brand=foo` + `Model=bar`                   | No `Name=` field exists in WDR                                                                 |
| Manually entering Qts        | Enter Qms + Qes only, set Qts=C in ParState | WinISD computes Qts; a manually pinned Qts (ParState=E) will not update when Qms or Qes change |
| Entering Vas directly        | Enter Mms+Cms+Sd+BL+Re                      | Computed Vas is internally consistent with environment; entered Vas may not match              |
| Xmax in p-p for SB Acoustics | Xmax ÷ 2 then ÷ 1000                        | SB Acoustics labels are p-p; WinISD needs one-way peak in metres                               |
| Stripping `c=` and `roo=`    | Always include both                         | Genuine WinISD fields; stripping may change simulation results                                 |

## 8. ParState

### 8.1 Overview

`ParState` is a fixed 49-character string encoding WinISD's internal view of how each
parameter was set. Introduced in alpha7 (2004).

Source: versions.txt alpha7 — "Added parameter tracking to the driver editor. Now driver
editor tracks which parameters were entered and which were calculated."

Each character:

| Char | Meaning                                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| E    | User **Entered** the value in the WinISD UI                        |
| C    | WinISD **Calculated** from other entered params                    |
| N    | **Not set** (parameter not applicable or never entered/calculated) |

The 49 positions do **not** correspond to WDR file line positions — they map to WinISD's
internal parameter list, which is not publicly documented (WinISD is closed-source).

### 8.2 Observed ParState values

**Source of truth:** `drivers/sample/` (single-parameter probe experiments, real WinISD
0.7.0.950) and `drivers/matt/` (real WinISD files from human data entry). See §8.4 for the
confirmed position map and `drivers/sample/README.md` for probe methodology.

**Blank driver** — nothing entered (`drivers/sample/john-all-defaults.wdr`):

```
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCC
```

numVC (pos 24, 1-indexed) always E; c (pos 48) and roo (pos 49) always C.

**Typical real WinISD entry** — most common pattern in `drivers/matt/` when user enters
Qms, Pe, Re, Le, BL, Xmax, Cms, Mms, Sd and WinISD computes the rest:

```
CCECEENNEENEECCCEECCNCCENNCCCNNNCCCCNCNNNNNNNNNCC
```

**All T/S params entered** (`drivers/sample/john-all-noncalc-fields-manually-entered.wdr`):

```
CEECEEECCEECEEECECCENCCEECCCCNNNCCCCCCNNNNNNNNNCC
```

**Minimum entry — only Qms and Qes** (`drivers/sample/inconsistency-test-saved-q.wdr`,
empirically produced 2026-06-28):

```
NNNNNNNNNNNNEECNNNNNNNNENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCC
```

WinISD computed Qts=C from Qms=E + Qes=E on save.

**Bad scraper pattern — do not copy fixed template strings:**
A scraper that writes a fixed ParState for every driver (regardless of which fields were actually scraped) will mark computed fields like Qts, Vd, Dd as E — permanently pinning them and preventing WinISD from managing them. Scrapers must build ParState dynamically based on which fields were actually sourced.

### 8.3 VCCon and ParState

VCCon has **no ParState position** — confirmed by exhaustive single-parameter probe
methodology (see `drivers/sample/PARSTATE_FINDINGS.md`). Even with all T/S params present
and `VCCon=1` in the file, no ParState position changes. VCCon is pure WDR metadata, not
part of WinISD's 49-position internal state machine. Source: WINISD.md §12.

### 8.4 Position mapping

**Fully confirmed** from single-parameter probe experiments in `drivers/sample/` — see
`drivers/sample/README.md` for full methodology and probe file list. 47 of 49 positions
confirmed; 2 unknown (pos 21 and 47, 1-indexed — always N, never reached by any probe).

`drivers/sample/README.md` uses **0-indexed** positions (0–48). This table uses **1-indexed**
(1–49) — subtract 1 to get the README index.

**Coverage: 47/49 confirmed.** Positions 21 and 47 (1-indexed) are always N; their field
identity is unknown.

**Key non-obvious mappings (WDR write order ≠ ParState order):**

- Qts is written first in WDR but is at ParState pos 15 (after Qms=13, Qes=14)
- EBP appears near dims in WDR write order but is at ParState pos 34
- VCCon appears in WDR between Gloss and c but has **no ParState slot** (§8.3)

Source: `drivers/sample/README.md` (single-parameter probe methodology, WinISD 0.7.0.950,
2026-06-26). Supersedes the inferred table previously in this section and the position data
in `drivers/sample/PARSTATE-FINDINGS.md` (which carries a WARNING that its positions are wrong).

Conclusion: The field ordering is independent of the ParState, which is reasonable as this
is a K/V pair file format order should not matter.

## 9. Provenance sidecar — `_meta.yml`

Each WDR file has a companion `<stem>_meta.yml` in the same directory. The sidecar holds all
provenance, quality, and data-quality metadata. WDR files contain no provenance data — they
end at `ParState=` and are schema-identical to a native WinISD export.

**Schema and field definitions:** `scripts/wdr_meta_schema.py` — `MetaModel` (Pydantic v2).
That file is the single source of truth. Reading it IS reading the `_meta.yml` schema.

**Example** (`drivers/new_ss_tool/Scan-Speak_18WE_4542T00_meta.yml`):

### 10.1 Parameter entry order

Enable **Auto calculate unknowns** before entering any parameters. Official recommended
order (source: `usingwinisd/newdriver.html`):

1. Mms + Cms → gives Fs. If unavailable, enter Fs and one of the two.
2. Sd + BL + Re → gives most derived fields except Qms, Qts, Vas.
3. Rms **or** Qms — either works; Qms preferred (directly measurable).
4. Hc + Hg + Pe. If Hc/Hg unavailable, enter Xmax directly.
5. numVC — number of voice coils.
6. Correct Znom if necessary.

**Minimum viable entry** (basic graphs only): Qts + Vas + Fs.
