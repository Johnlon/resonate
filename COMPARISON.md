# Resonate — Feature Comparison

This table serves two purposes:
- **Promotional** — what Resonate offers today vs. the tools it replaces or complements.
- **Todo list** — features not yet implemented are marked 🚧 and linked to the roadmap.

Comparison is primarily against **WinISD** (the tool Resonate is designed to replace or
extend), with notes on other tools where relevant.

**Confidence markers** (WinISD column only — per the project's anti-hallucination rule):
- ✅ Confirmed — source: WINISD.md, WinISD help file, or direct user observation
- ⚠ Assumed — plausible but not directly verified; see WINISD.md for details
- ❌ Confirmed absent — observed directly or follows from platform constraints

## Planned but not yet implemented (Resonate todo)

Items not in the table above, roughly in priority order.
See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to claim one or discuss prioritisation.

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| 6th-order bandpass | Good first issue — template already exists as 4th-order |
| Isobaric / compound loading | Good first issue — acoustic circuit extension |
| Baffle-step / diffraction correction | Well-understood model; needs a curve and a UI toggle |
| Step response curve | Inverse FFT of transfer function; rendering work only |
| `.wpr` WinISD project import | Lazarus binary component stream; needs a sample file |
| Mobile / small-screen layout | Responsive CSS pass; no new physics |
| Measurement import (REW `.mdat`, FRD) | Would allow measured response overlay alongside simulation |
| Impedance measurement → T/S extraction | Closed-box or added-mass method; valuable for DIY builders |
| Multi-way SPL summation (with crossovers) | Large feature; needs crossover design first |
| Crossover design | Out of scope for v1; see VituixCAD for now |
| Polar response / directivity | Out of scope for v1 |
