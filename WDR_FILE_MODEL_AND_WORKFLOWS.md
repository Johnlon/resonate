# Driver library data model

## File format — WDR

Each driver is a single `.wdr` file (WinISD Driver Record). The format is plain
`key=value`, one field per line, with a `[Driver]` section header. Standard fields
are defined by WinISD; unknown fields are silently ignored by WinISD and other
parsers, making the format safely extensible.

## Extension fields — `boxbench_` prefix

All Resonate-specific metadata is stored in the same `.wdr` file using a
`boxbench_` prefix so it is clearly namespaced away from WinISD fields.
WinISD and other parsers ignore these lines.

### ⚠ Hard rule — "human verified" language

**No AI agent may write the words "human verified", "human-verified", "verified by human", or any equivalent phrase** in
any `boxbench_` field — not in `boxbench_corrections`, `boxbench_detail`, `boxbench_reviewedBy`, or anywhere else —
unless the project owner has explicitly granted permission for that specific driver or batch in the current session.

- `boxbench_corrections` is AI-owned. An AI writing "I confirmed X" in that field is not verification — it is the AI's
  own account of what it did, which may be wrong.
- `boxbench_reviewedBy` must be `null` or absent until the project owner says "mark as human verified" or equivalent.
- AI agents MAY ask once if they believe the owner has reviewed the data and forgotten to grant permission. They must
  not assume or proceed without an explicit yes.

This rule exists because a previous AI agent wrote "confirmed against Dayton Audio PA460-8 datasheet (user-provided)" in
`boxbench_corrections` while simultaneously storing the wrong product's PDF URL. The language implied verification that
had not occurred.

### Adding new fields

Use the `boxbench_` prefix and a `snake_case` name. Values must be single-line
(no newlines). Keep values concise — WDR files are plain text and must remain
human-readable.

---

## Link-field population workflow — rules for AI agents and scrapers

These rules apply every time a `boxbench_` link field is written, whether by a
scraper, a backfill script, or an AI agent working on an individual file. Follow
them in order. **Do not skip the inspection steps.**

### `boxbench_datasheet`

1. Obtain a candidate URL (from the product page, sitemap, or scraper output).
2. **Verify it resolves to a PDF.** The URL must end in `.pdf` or return
   `Content-Type: application/pdf`. If the server returns HTML, a ZIP, or a
   redirect to a product page → do not set this field.
3. **Check the PDF filename contains the model number** (or a recognisable
   abbreviation of it). If the filename contains a clearly different model
   number, stop — you have the wrong PDF. This is a hard gate; do not skip it.
   > Real failure: `Dayton Audio PA460-8` had its datasheet set to a
   > parts-express URL for the `RSS460HO-4` — a different product. The PDF
   > filename `295-472-dayton-audio-rss460ho-4-specifications.pdf` would have
   > caught this immediately.
4. **Check the PDF is product-specific, not a manufacturer catalog.** Reject any
   URL whose filename matches catalog patterns: `*catalog*`, `*Catalog*`,
   `*catalogue*`, `*Catalogo*`, `-WEB.pdf`. A catalog covers many products and
   is not a datasheet. If only a catalog is available, leave `boxbench_datasheet`
   unset and set `boxbench_manu_page` instead.
   > Real failure: 14 SICA drivers, 4 HiVi Swan, and 2 PRV Audio drivers had
   > their datasheet set to full manufacturer catalog PDFs scraped from
   > SoundImports. None were product-specific.
5. **If the PDF URL is from a different domain than the scraped source**, apply
   extra scrutiny. Verify the filename matches the current product's model
   before setting the field.
   > Real failure: the PA460-8 `boxbench_corrections` field (AI-written) stated
   > "confirmed against Dayton Audio PA460-8 datasheet" while the URL it stored
   > was for the RSS460HO-4 — a different product on a different domain. The AI
   > agent asserted a verification step it did not actually perform. **A
   > `boxbench_corrections` note claiming verification is not evidence of
   > verification.** The filename check in step 3 is the real gate.
6. **Duplicate URL check:** if the same PDF URL already exists in another WDR
   for a different model in the same collection, it is almost certainly a
   catalog or wrong product. Do not reuse it.
7. Set the field to the internet URL. Also download the PDF to
   `<collection>/datasheets/` for local caching. The WDR holds the internet URL;
   the local copy is a cache only.
8. **If no PDF is found** → leave `boxbench_datasheet` unset. Set
   `boxbench_manu_page` so a human reviewer can find the datasheet later.

### `boxbench_manu_page` and `boxbench_vendor_page`

The directory a WDR lives in tells you what kind of site was scraped. Use that
to decide which field(s) to fill:

| Directory / scraped site                                                  | `boxbench_manu_page`                           | `boxbench_vendor_page` |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `sb-acoustics/`, `scan-speak/`, `wavecor/` — manufacturer sells direct    | ✓ set to scraped URL                           | leave unset            |
| `parts-express/`, `soundimports/` — third-party retailer                  | leave unset (manu page unknown at scrape time) | ✓ set to scraped URL   |
| `dayton-audio/` scraped from daytonaudio.com — manu who also sells direct | ✓ set to scraped URL                           | ✓ set to same URL      |

Rules:

- Only set a field when the scraped site actually fulfils that role. Do not copy
  the retailer URL into `boxbench_manu_page` or vice versa.
- If a separate manufacturer page is discovered during a retailer scrape (e.g.
  the PE listing links to a Dayton Audio product page), set `boxbench_manu_page`
  to that URL as well.
- Do not set either field to a brand homepage or a category listing.

### `boxbench_source`

Generic provenance field — always set, regardless of site type.

For scraped drivers this is typically the same URL as `boxbench_vendor_page`
or `boxbench_manu_page` (whichever applies). It exists as a separate field to
cover sources that are neither vendor nor manufacturer listings — a GitHub repo
of community measurements, an AVS Forum post, a raw datasheet. In those cases
`boxbench_vendor_page` and `boxbench_manu_page` may be unset while
`boxbench_source` still records where the numbers came from.

**If in doubt:** `boxbench_source` = the URL you would give someone who asked
"where did you get these T/S numbers?"

### `boxbench_frd`

**This is the most abuse-prone field. Follow these steps exactly.**

1. Obtain a candidate URL.
2. **Fetch the URL.** If it returns a 404 or network error → do not set this
   field. A broken URL is worse than no URL.
3. **Determine the file type:**
    - URL ends in `.frd`, `.txt`, `.zma` → inspect the first few lines. It must
      look like whitespace-separated columns of numbers (freq, amplitude, phase).
      If it does → set `boxbench_frd` (or `boxbench_impedance` for ZMA/impedance).
      If it contains HTML, XML, or binary → do not set.
    - URL ends in `.zip` → **download and list the contents before setting
      anything.** A ZIP must contain at least one `.frd`, `.zma`, or tab-separated
      `.txt` measurement file to qualify. If the ZIP contains only:
        - `.igs`, `.step`, `.x_t`, `.stp`, `.dwg`, `.dxf` files → it is a CAD
          archive. Do not set `boxbench_frd`. No `boxbench_` field exists yet for
          mechanical/CAD files.
        - `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.png` only → it is a graph archive, not raw data. Do not
          set `boxbench_frd`.
        - A mix of FRD data and other files → the ZIP qualifies; set `boxbench_frd`.
    - URL ends in `.pdf` → it is a datasheet, not measurement data. Set
      `boxbench_datasheet` instead. Never set `boxbench_frd` to a PDF URL.
4. Set the field to the **internet URL**. Cache the file locally alongside the
   WDR. Do not set the field to a local file path — ever.
5. **If the same ZIP contains both FRD and impedance data** → set `boxbench_frd`
   to the ZIP URL only. Do not also set `boxbench_impedance` to the same ZIP — it
   is redundant and misleading.

### `boxbench_impedance`

1. Same rules as `boxbench_frd` — verify the content before setting.
2. Only set if the impedance data is in a **separate** file or URL from
   `boxbench_frd`. If both are in the same ZIP → `boxbench_frd` covers it.
3. A valid impedance file has columns: freq (Hz) / impedance (Ω) / phase (°).

| ZIP found on vendor site — contents unknown                            | Download it, list contents (see `boxbench_frd` step 3), then decide. Never set `boxbench_frd` without inspection             |

| URL resolves but download fails (timeout, SSL error)                   | Do not set the field. Log the error. A cached file from a previous run is acceptable if it passes the content check          |
| Manufacturer changes URL after field was set                           | During a scraper refresh, re-verify all link fields. Update stale URLs. Set `DateModified` to the refresh date               |

## Automated DQ check

Run `node scripts/dq-check.mjs` from the repo root after any bulk import, scrape, or manual edit session. It scans every
WDR file and flags physically impossible or highly suspicious T/S values.

```
node scripts/dq-check.mjs                     # all collections
node scripts/dq-check.mjs --collection matt   # one collection only
```

The script flags issues by rule ID and groups them. **Always triage the output before committing new driver data.**
Known false-positive patterns:

| Rule      | Known false positives                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Sd_huge` | Legitimate 21-24" subwoofers have Sd 1600-2300 cm² — not a bug        |
| `Re_low`  | 1Ω nominal drivers and DVC drivers in parallel can have Re < 1Ω       |
| `Fs_high` | Very small tweeters (< 10mm) can have Fs 3-6 kHz                      |
| `Qms_low` | Some compression drivers and waveguide-loaded tweeters have Qms < 0.5 |

Known systematic scraper bugs that this tool catches:

| Rule             | Root cause                                                |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Pe_one`         | Comma number parse bug: "1,000 W" parsed as 1             |
| `Fs_low`         | Compression/horn tweeters: Fs stored in kHz instead of Hz |
| `Xmax_huge`      | Xmax stored in mm or μm instead of metres                 |
| `Qts_impossible` | Scraper stored Qts value in Qes field, or Qms missing     |

**AI + tool together:** The DQ script catches systematic scraper bugs fast and repeatably. Use it first. Then apply AI
judgement for borderline cases the script flags as suspicious but cannot auto-classify (e.g. Re_low, Qms_low) — the AI
can fetch the manufacturer datasheet and verify.

## Provenance rules

- Every driver file must have `ProvidedBy=` set to the collection or individual
  that supplied the data.
- If the data was scraped automatically, set `boxbench_quality=M` and
  `boxbench_issue=scraped_not_human_verified` until a human verifies it.
- If a `boxbench_dq_issue` is present, the file is flagged for correction and
  must not be treated as authoritative.

## Future feature: driver type classification and matching

This section documents the community rules that will underpin two planned
features:

1. **Type-based filtering** in the driver browser (tweeter / midrange / woofer /
   subwoofer / passive radiator / full-range)
2. **Matching assistant** — given a loaded driver, suggest complementary drivers
   from the library (e.g. "tweeters that pair well with the DS115-8")

> **⚠ UNVERIFIED DRAFT — for discussion only.**
> The rules below are written from general DIY and small-signal loudspeaker
> design understanding. No primary sources (textbooks, AES papers, or
> authoritative community references) were fetched or verified during this
> session. Every threshold and formula should be cross-checked before this
> section is treated as authoritative. Citations are TBD. Do not implement
> algorithms based on the numbers here without verification.

### Driver type classification

A driver's type is not stored in the WDR format. It must be inferred from T/S
parameters. The following heuristics are proposed for the browser filter:

| Type                 | Primary criterion     | Secondary checks                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Subwoofer**        | Fs < 35 Hz            | Sd large, Pe > 100 W, Xmax > 10 mm         |
| **Woofer**           | 35 Hz ≤ Fs < 100 Hz   | Sd > 80 cm², Pe > 30 W                     |
| **Mid-bass**         | 100 Hz ≤ Fs < 300 Hz  | Sd 30–150 cm²                              |
| **Midrange**         | 300 Hz ≤ Fs < 1000 Hz | Sd 5–50 cm²                                |
| **Full-range**       | 80 Hz ≤ Fs < 600 Hz   | Sd small (< 40 cm²), wide usable bandwidth |
| **Tweeter**          | Fs ≥ 1000 Hz          | Sd < 10 cm², Pe < 50 W                     |
| **Passive radiator** | No voice coil         | Re = 0 or missing, no Qes                  |

These thresholds are approximate. Many drivers (especially full-range) overlap
multiple categories. The classification should be a best-guess label, not a hard
gate. ⚠ thresholds need validation against the actual library contents.

Note: `Fs ≥ 1000 Hz` alone is a weak tweeter discriminator — many dome tweeters
have Fs in the 500–1000 Hz range and would be misfiled as midrange. `Sd < 10 cm²`
(small piston) is the stronger primary criterion for tweeters; `Fs` should be
used as a secondary check only.

---

### Crossover matching rules

The following rules define whether a given tweeter (or midrange) is a
reasonable crossover partner for a given woofer. All rules must be satisfied
simultaneously for a "good match" — a driver that passes only some is flagged as
a "marginal match."

#### Rule 1 — Tweeter minimum crossover (Fs constraint)

A tweeter should not be crossed below a multiple of its free-air resonance:

```
f_cross_min = k × Fs_tweeter
```

where **k = 3** is the minimum (⚠ some designers use 4). Crossing closer to Fs
causes elevated harmonic distortion and risks mechanical damage from over-excursion
near resonance.

Example: a tweeter with Fs = 1200 Hz must not be crossed below ~3600 Hz.

#### Rule 2 — Woofer maximum crossover (beaming constraint)

A direct-radiator piston begins to beam (narrows its horizontal dispersion) when
the acoustic wavelength approaches the piston circumference. Above this frequency
the off-axis response falls relative to on-axis, producing a narrow "listening
window." The onset frequency is approximately:

```
f_beam ≈ c / (π × Dd)
```

where **c = 344 m/s** (speed of sound) and **Dd** is the effective piston
diameter (m) derived from Sd: `Dd = 2 × √(Sd / π)`.

⚠ Convention matters: different communities pick different thresholds. `c/(π·Dd)`
is the ka=1 onset (circumference = wavelength), the most conservative limit. A
less conservative rule uses λ=Dd → `c/Dd` (~3× higher — e.g. 6½″: ~2650 Hz
instead of ~840 Hz). Switching conventions shifts the ceiling by a factor of 3,
so the choice is load-bearing. Treat the table values as conservative guidance
only; real drivers also deviate from an ideal rigid piston, and baffle width and
listening axis add further variation.

| Nominal size | Typical Sd | Dd (derived) | f_beam   |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| 4″           | 53 cm²     | 82 mm        | ~1340 Hz |
| 5¼″          | 87 cm²     | 105 mm       | ~1040 Hz |
| 6½″          | 134 cm²    | 130 mm       | ~840 Hz  |
| 8″           | 214 cm²    | 165 mm       | ~665 Hz  |
| 10″          | 346 cm²    | 210 mm       | ~520 Hz  |
| 12″          | 506 cm²    | 254 mm       | ~430 Hz  |

The crossover must be set below `f_beam` to avoid a sudden on-axis peak at the
crossover frequency (the region where the woofer is still contributing but
beaming, while the tweeter has not yet taken over fully).

#### Rule 3 — Valid crossover window

Rules 1 and 2 define a window:

```
f_cross_min  (tweeter Fs × 3)  <  f_cross  <  f_cross_max  (woofer f_beam)
```

If the window is negative (tweeter Fs × 3 > woofer f_beam), the pair **cannot**
be crossed compatibly — the tweeter's minimum safe crossover is above the
woofer's beaming limit. Flag as incompatible.

If the window exists but is less than one octave, flag as "tight — requires
care."

#### Rule 4 — Sensitivity matching

The nominal SPL sensitivity of the two drivers at the crossover frequency should
be close. A large mismatch requires resistive padding (L-pad) on the louder
driver, which wastes power and raises the effective source impedance.

| SPL difference | Assessment                                                                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ≤ 2 dB         | Excellent match                                                             |
| 2–4 dB         | Good — minor padding or baffle step correction will align                   |
| 4–6 dB         | Marginal — padding is needed; verify thermal power in the attenuated driver |
| > 6 dB         | Poor — large L-pad raises impedance, complicates crossover design           |

⚠ This rule applies at the crossover frequency, not at 1 W / 1 m. If a woofer
has rising response near its crossover and a tweeter has a peak around its Fs,
the effective sensitivity mismatch at the crossover frequency may differ from the
nominal SPL figures. Full FRD data is needed for accurate assessment.

#### Rule 5 — Power handling at the crossover frequency

The tweeter power rating must be adequate for the signal power that passes
through a high-pass filter at the chosen crossover frequency. For a 2nd-order
(12 dB/oct) Linkwitz-Riley filter, the power above the crossover is
approximately half the total amplifier power (⚠ simplified — actual depends on
programme content and filter shape).

A conservative guide: tweeter Pe should be ≥ 20% of the total system rated
power for a 2-way system at a moderate crossover slope. Higher-order filters
(24 dB/oct, 4th-order L-R) offer better tweeter protection.

### EBP as a box-type guide

The Efficiency Bandwidth Product `EBP = Fs / Qes` is a widely used heuristic
for which box type suits a woofer:

| EBP    | Suggests                                                                            |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| < 50   | Sealed (IB) — driver has high Qes and is better damped electrically in a sealed box |
| 50–100 | Either sealed or vented — designer's choice                                         |
| > 100  | Vented — driver has low Qes and benefits from port tuning to restore bass extension |

⚠ EBP is a fast heuristic, not a substitute for modelling. A driver with EBP =
110 can still work well in a sealed box if cabinet size and desired extension
allow. Use it as the first-pass filter only.

---

### Passive radiator sizing rules

A passive radiator (PR) replaces the port in a vented alignment. Matching rules:

| Parameter    | Rule                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sd (PR)**  | ≥ Sd of the active driver, ideally 1.0–2.0× ⚠                                                                                                               |
| **Mmd (PR)** | Tuned so the PR-box resonance fb ≈ port-tuned equivalent: `Mmd ≈ (ρ₀ × c² × Sd_pr² ) / (Vas × (2π×fb)²)`. In practice, PRs ship with adjustable mass rings. |
| **Qms (PR)** | Should be >> 3 (very low mechanical loss); a lossy PR damps the tuning peak and lowers output near fb.                                                      |
| **Fs (PR)**  | Lower is better — ideally Fs_pr < fb so the PR moves freely at the tuning frequency.                                                                        |

### Proposed matching algorithm (future implementation)

Given a loaded driver D, a matching query returns candidate partners ranked by
suitability. Steps:

1. **Classify D** using the type heuristics above.
2. **Compute D's crossover constraint**:
    - If D is a woofer/mid-bass: `f_cross_max = c / (π × Dd_D)`
    - If D is a tweeter: `f_cross_min = 3 × Fs_D`
3. **For each candidate C in the library:**
   a. Classify C.
   b. Skip if C is the same type as D (woofer–woofer pairs are not relevant here).
   c. Compute the crossover window (Rule 3). Skip if window is negative.
   d. Score:
    - Window width in octaves (wider = better)
    - Sensitivity delta (smaller = better, > 6 dB = fail)
    - Power handling (Pe_tweeter vs system power estimate)
4. **Sort by score, return top N.**

The algorithm intentionally does not pick the crossover frequency — it tells the
designer whether a pair *can* be crossed, not where to cross them. That choice
depends on room acoustics, baffle diffraction, and filter design, all of which
are outside the scope of T/S parameters alone.

## Provenance sidecar — `_meta.yml`

Each driver has a companion `DriverName_meta.yml` YAML file holding all
provenance and quality metadata: `quality`, `issue`, `detail`, `corrections`,
`reviewed_by`, `datasheet`, `manu_page`, `vendor_page`, `source`, `frd`,
`impedance`, `obsolete`, `dq_issue`, `community`, `fetched_sku`.

This data is kept out of the `.wdr` file entirely — WDR files end at `ParState=`
and contain no `boxbench_*` or other non-WinISD fields. The sidecar is the
sole location for provenance; the WDR is schema-identical to a native WinISD export.

Prior to 2026-06-26 this metadata was stored as `boxbench_*` fields appended
after `ParState=` in the WDR itself. Those fields have been stripped from all
collections and migrated to YAML sidecars.

## Scripts reference

All tooling lives in `scripts/`. Run from the repo root. Every bulk workflow step should use these scripts rather than
ad-hoc commands.
