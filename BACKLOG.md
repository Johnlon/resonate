# Resonate — backlog

Working list of capabilities that make Resonate a complete, professional
enclosure-design tool. Items are described on their own terms; each notes how it
fits the existing engine so it can become a GitHub issue. Priorities are a guide,
not a contract — pick what interests you and open a PR.

Companion documents: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) (re-architecture phases and gates) ·
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) (coding practices) · [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
(hard decisions).

**P0** = foundation, gates everything below · **P1** = high value, tractable on
today's engine · **P2** = larger but well-defined · **P3** = big rocks (design first).

**Test status tags** — `[unit]` = logic lives in `src/core/` as an independent module
with tests in `test/`; `[ui]` = covered by Playwright browser automation in
`test/app.browser.spec.js`. No tag = untested or not yet extracted from the UI.
⚠ CI (`ci.yml`) runs only `engine.test.mjs` + `golden.test.mjs` + Playwright —
`alignments.test.mjs` and `complex.test.mjs` exist but are not yet wired into CI.

## P0 — Test & architecture foundation

**Status: complete.** `src/core/` is fully extracted (7 modules), golden-master
fixtures cover all box types, CONTRACT.md is written and versioned, per-module unit
tests exist, the Vue UI consumes only the public contract, and Playwright + CI are
both live. The description below is preserved for history.

> ~~Resonate is a spike: logic is one inline script in `index.html`, "verified" by a
> self-test that string-slices the engine out and `eval`s it, with no real UI tests.~~
> Completed — see [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

Full plan: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) ·
practices: [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) · oracles:
[references.md](references.md).

- [x] **P0 · Phase 0** Golden-master fixtures: freeze current sweep outputs for
      every box type, assert equality — the net that proves extraction preserves
      behaviour, before any code moves. `[unit]`
- [x] **P0 · Phase 1** Extract the core (`complex`, `driver`, `wdr`, `circuit`,
      `sweep`, `alignments`, `filters`) into `src/core/*.js` — no DOM — one module
      at a time, **extracting not rewriting**. `[unit]`
- [x] **P0 · Phase 2** Define & version the `Design → Curves` contract
      (`CONTRACT.md`) — the documented API third-party UIs depend on. `[unit]`
- [x] **P0 · Phase 3** Per-module functional tests vs tiered oracles (closed
      forms > datasheets > alignment tables > cross-tool). `[unit]`
- [x] **P0 · Phase 4** Rebuild the Resonate UI on the core contract only. `[ui]`
- [x] **P0 · Phase 5** Playwright functional tests + CI runs unit + golden +
      functional on every push / PR. `[ui]`
- [ ] **Research** Chrome's MCP server as a functional-test driver — evaluate vs
      Playwright for driving the real app and checking rendered canvases.
- [ ] **P1 · Phase 6** Mobile / responsive (PWA) UI as a second consumer of the
      core — proves the decoupling; deferred, not part of the foundation.
- [ ] **P1** Error visibility sized to a static client tool: global error
      boundary + a debug-log toggle (not an observability stack).
- [x] **P0** Persist design across reloads (ctrl-R keeps the driver) — localStorage
- [x] **P0** Power input convention: primary input is **power (W)**, voltage derived
