# drivers/sample — WinISD experiment files

This directory contains REAL WDR files created directly in WinISD 0.7.0.950 to
reverse-engineer its internal behaviour. **Not real drivers** — dummy values only.

THESE ARE REAL REFERENCES that have not been modified by AI. 

"Auto calculate unknowns" was always enabled during all experiments. Because WinISD
cannot derive anything from a single T/S input, every single-param probe produces
exactly one new E position — a clean, unambiguous mapping.

---

## Single-parameter probe files (`s-*.wdr`)

Each file has exactly one T/S field set to a non-zero value (unless noted). Comparing
its `ParState=` string against the blank file isolates the ParState index for that field.

### VCCon — save bug, position unknown

`VCCon` is a WDR field (parallel/serial wiring) but WinISD always writes `VCCon=1`
regardless of the UI setting — the save is buggy. Because it can never be set to E,
probing its ParState position is impossible. The connection probe files
(`s-connection-*.wdr`) all show no new E position.

`VCCon=1` means parallel; `VCCon=2` means serial. Reading is correct — opening a
hand-edited `VCCon=2` file does display as serial. Only saving is broken.

**Conclusion:** VCCon is not tracked in ParState. The s-driver-12345678 probe had
`VCCon=1` present and all 8 dim fields set, yet pos 46 stayed N. With all other
positions accounted for, VCCon has no ParState slot — it is pure WDR metadata.

## Multi-parameter scenario files

|------|----------|---------|
| `john-all-defaults.wdr` | Blank driver — nothing entered | `NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCC` |
| `john-all-set-then-cleaded.wdr` | All fields set, then Clear button hit | `NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCC` — identical to blank; Clear resets all state |
| `john-all-set.wdr` | Every Parameters-tab field typed in; physical dimensions at 0 | `EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNEE` |
| `john-all-entered-driver-dims.wdr` | Same as above plus all Dimensions-tab fields entered | `EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENEE` |
| `john-all-entered-driver-dim123s.wdr` | Same with sequential dim values | `EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENEE` — identical ParState to dims file |

## Key findings

### WDR write order ≠ ParState internal order

WinISD writes WDR fields in one order but numbers its internal parameters differently.
Notable mismatches:

- **Qts** is written first in WDR but is at ParState pos 14 (after Qms=12, Qes=13)
- **EBP** appears in WDR near the dims block but is at ParState pos 33 (thermal group)
- **VCCon** appears in WDR between Gloss and c but has no confirmed ParState position

### Three unresolved positions

| Pos | Behaviour | Likely candidate |
|:---:|-----------|-----------------|
| 20 | Always N | Dia? VCCon? Unknown |
| 41 | Confirmed via s-driver-12345678 (Magnet=4) | Magnet |
| 46 | Always N | VCCon? Unknown |

### `no` (η₀) is at pos 22 and IS enterable

`no` can be E when typed directly, C when computed from T/S, or N when nothing is set.
The s-no probe confirms pos 22.

### Clear == blank

`john-all-set-then-cleaded.wdr` ParState is byte-for-byte identical to
`john-all-defaults.wdr`. The Clear button resets every param to N; numVC returns to
E=1; c/roo return to C.

### Pos 20 and 46 are permanently N

Neither position has ever been observed as anything other than N across all probe files
and multi-param scenarios, including `john-all-set.wdr` where every visible UI field
was entered. These positions may be internal WinISD fields with no corresponding UI
entry point.

## Authoritative sources

Only two sources are authoritative for WinISD behaviour:

1. **WinISD.exe itself** — behaviour observed by running the application.
2. **WinISD help files** — `research/winisd/help/`.

Do not infer WinISD behaviour from Resonate source code, forum posts, or third-party
documentation without cross-checking against one of these two sources.
