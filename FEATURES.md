# Resonate — Feature List

The full picture of what Resonate is and where it's going. Includes notes on
alternative tools (00 Enclosure Simulator, SpeakerDesign.dev, SpeakerBoxLite,
SoundForm) for orientation. This doubles as a backlog: if a ⬜ item appeals,
claim it in an issue.

**Legend:** ✅ done · 🔨 in progress · ⬜ planned · *“seen in X”* = demand already
proven by another tool.

## Alternative tools

Good tools exist. Use whichever works best for you. These notes are for
orientation, not criticism — we record them so contributors understand the
landscape and can spot gaps worth filling.

### 00 Enclosure Simulator — <https://simulator.00aud.io/>
*by mbdavis · free, no login, closed source*

The most fully-developed browser-based simulator in the field as of mid-2025.
Around 65 shipped features including: amplifier-load graph, interactive
lumped-model schematic view, on-graph parametric EQ + HP/LP + Linkwitz
transform + shelf filters, URL-encoded shareable designs, imports **`.wdr`,
`.wpr`, and Unibox** spreadsheets, exports WinISD-compatible files. Has a
public voted roadmap (<https://simulator.00aud.io/roadmap>) and a WinISD
feature comparison (<https://simulator.00aud.io/compare/winisd-vs-00-simulator>).

The author has publicly pledged to open-source the code if the project ever
goes inactive. The pledge is on record; the code is not yet public.

Driver data and any design saves are not explicitly offered as open-access or
exportable in bulk.

---

### SpeakerDesign.dev — <https://speakerdesign.dev/>
*free, no login, closed source*

A broad, polished suite: guided Driver Wizard (sealed presets; vented
QB3/SBB4/EBS), Box Simulator covering the same graph set as Resonate plus
full Ql/Qa/Qp losses, 1–4 vents (round or slot), selectable end-correction,
drag-to-adjust Vb/Fb with axis locking, frequency range presets, and
configurable listening distance. Also includes a detailed Box Calculator (six
assembly cases, driver/port/bracing/lining displacement, cut list), a
Cutlist Optimiser (bin-packing, kerf, rotate, fractional inches, PDF output),
and an open knowledge base with tutorials.

Sealed and vented only as of the survey date (bandpass, PR, and ABC listed as
coming). No `.wdr` import or export noted. Broader than Resonate on
construction and education; roughly matched on core simulation.

---

### SpeakerBoxLite — <https://speakerboxlite.com/>
*freemium / pay-as-you-go, web + iOS + Android, closed source*

The most feature-complete tool in the field: 5,000+ drivers, transmission
line, full crossover suite, 3D enclosure builder, STL port export. A good,
well-regarded site that covers the basics of enclosure simulation clearly.

**Graph discrepancy noted:** for the same driver and box parameters, SpeakerBoxLite
can produce noticeably different curves from Resonate (and from WinISD) on some
outputs — particularly SPL and excursion. The cause is not known. It may reflect
a difference in the transfer-function model, loss assumptions, radiation
convention, or a combination. This is an open question; anyone who diagnoses it
is encouraged to open an issue or PR with findings.

The driver database (5,000+ entries) is not made available as open-access data.
Users can export individual designs but there is no bulk export or community
commons equivalent to `drivers/`.

---

### SoundForm
*by u/BusyEntrepreneur9636 · closed beta, access by DM*
<https://www.reddit.com/r/diyaudio/comments/1snqre1/new_features_for_web_based_winisd_app/>

In closed beta as of the survey date. Crossover design and multi-driver
summation appear to be a focus. No independent testing performed.

---

### Biquad Cookbook EQ Designer — <https://loudifier.github.io/Biquad-Cookbook/>
*by loudifier · free, open source, GitHub-hosted*

A focused, modern web-based EQ filter designer that complements (not replaces)
enclosure simulators. Provides 15+ filter types (1st/2nd order lowpass, highpass,
allpass, shelves, peaking EQ, bandpass, notch, Linkwitz transform) with real-time
visualization across four plot types: frequency response, phase, impulse response,
and group delay. Includes a filter optimizer that matches a target curve or flattens
a response. Saves/loads EQ configurations in YAML format. Orthogonal to Resonate’s
scope — Biquad focuses on signal-chain EQ filter design while Resonate simulates
enclosure acoustics. Users often chain both tools: design an enclosure in Resonate,
then use Biquad to design corrective EQ to flatten the result.

### Driver library — 2,100+ drivers, instant load
- ✅ **Pre-bundled at build time** — all local `.wdr` collections are baked into
  the app JS; no GitHub API calls, no rate limits, no spinners. The full library
  loads in the same round-trip as the page itself.
- ✅ **Federated driver sources** — `drivers/sources.json` links external `.wdr`
  repos so the community can grow the library without forking Resonate; *no other
  surveyed tool federates its driver data*
- ✅ **In-app driver browser** — token-based multi-word search (case-insensitive,
  every word must match), pure alphabetical list, source tags with clickable links
- ✅ **Newer-version highlighting** — when the same driver exists in multiple
  collections, the entry with the latest `DateModified` is highlighted in accent
  colour; older copies are dimmed so you can see at a glance which measurement to
  trust and where it came from
- ✅ **Date normalisation** — dates from different scrapers and manual entries
  are canonicalised to `YYYY-MM-DD` for consistent display regardless of origin
- ✅ **SpeakerBoxLite opt-in** — one click loads ~6,000 community measurements
  from speakerboxlite.com on top of the bundled library (fetched live, CORS-permitting)
- ✅ **Paste any GitHub repo** — add a custom `owner/repo` or full GitHub URL to
  pull `.wdr` files from any public repository in the browser

### Vendor scrapers (automated data pipelines)
- ✅ **SB Acoustics** — 194 drivers scraped from sbacoustics.com, including
  the full Satori and SB series, with datasheet URLs in machine-readable `_meta.json`
- ✅ **Parts Express** — 1,509 drivers scraped from the PE woofer guide API;
  T/S parameters taken directly from the PE datasheet fields (not keyed by hand)

  growing (Accuton, HiVi, Faital, Morel, ScanSpeak, Seas, Satori, Wavecor, …)
- ⬜ **Wavecor**, **Dayton Audio** — scrapers written, pending full run
- ✅ **Meta file standard** — every scraped `.wdr` gets a `_meta.json` with
  quality grade (`M` = machine-scraped, unverified), datasheet URL, and scrape
  provenance so human reviewers know exactly where each number came from
- ✅ **WDR schema documentation** (`drivers/README.md`) — canonical field names,
  SI units, common mistakes table, date semantics, quality review workflow; the
  single source of truth for scraper authors and human contributors
- ⬜ Filter drivers by size / params; richer metadata index — *SpeakerBoxLite has 5,000+ / 300+ brands in one DB*

- ✅ **Federated driver data** — `drivers/sources.json` links external `.wdr`
  repos; add one via PR, no re-hosting
- ✅ **URL-encoded shareable designs** — paste a design as a link
- ✅ **Community contribution flow** — PR a `.wdr` file or a new source URL;
  WDR schema + meta standard documented so contributors know exactly what's expected
- ✅ Static hosting on GitHub Pages (<https://johnlon.github.io/resonate/>)

## 9. Learning & docs
- ✅ Documented engine + conventions (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- ⬜ Open knowledge base — T/S params, box types, tuning, box losses — *SpeakerDesign.dev has a closed one; an **open, community-editable** one would be a first*

## Honest competitive position

The field is more advanced than “WinISD is dead” implies. **00 Simulator** is
feature-rich and actively developed. **SpeakerDesign.dev** matches Resonate’s
graph set and exceeds it on vents and construction. **SpeakerBoxLite** is the
broadest tool (transmission line, full crossover, 5,000+ drivers) but paywalled.
On raw simulation features alone, Resonate is mid-pack today.

But the driver library story has changed materially. Resonate now ships with
**2,100+ bundled drivers** from SB Acoustics, Parts Express, and community
measurement collections — loaded instantly from the app bundle, not fetched from a
rate-limited API. A live scraper pipeline keeps that number growing. No surveyed
competitor offers an open, version-controlled, machine-readable driver commons with
automated ingestion pipelines and a human-review quality framework.

Resonate’s defensible edges:

- **Open source, fully and permanently.** MIT-licensed, public, and forkable
  today. The code belongs to everyone who uses it.
- **Open *data*, growing.** 2,100+ drivers in a version-controlled commons, with
  vendor scraper pipelines adding new measurements automatically. The data carries
  quality grades, datasheet provenance, and scrape timestamps so you know exactly
  where every number came from. No closed tool opens its aggregated driver data at
  all, let alone federates it.
- **Federated, not hoarded.** Any `.wdr` repo on GitHub can be linked into
  Resonate’s browser with one PR to `sources.json` — no re-hosting, no import
  queue. The commons grows without a central gatekeeper.
- **Provable physics.** Validated against closed-form Thiele/Small solutions,
  re-verified on every push in CI. No competitor surveyed makes this claim.
- **Truly ownerless longevity.** MIT + on disk in every clone = it cannot die,
  be paywalled, or have its driver data locked away.

## Where it needs to catch up
Construction output (volume calc, cut list, 3D), amplifier-load graph, richer
vents (multi/slot/selectable end-correction), 6th-order bandpass, `.wpr` import,
and datasheet→params paste. All tractable on the existing engine.

Note on EQ: Resonate includes basic parametric, HP/LP, and Linkwitz-transform
filters. For detailed multi-filter EQ design and optimization, Biquad Cookbook
(open-source companion tool) provides a focused, modern UI with 15+ filter types
and automated optimization against target curves.

## Strategic framing
Resonate’s pitch is not that it out-simulates the competition today — it doesn’t,
and we say so plainly above. The pitch is that open code *and* open data, together,
create something that benefits the whole speaker-building world: a permanent,
vendor-neutral commons that anyone can build on, contribute to, and trust. As the
driver library grows toward 5,000+ drivers with verified provenance, that shared
foundation becomes more valuable than any single tool’s feature list.
