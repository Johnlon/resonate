# Resonate — Feature List

The full picture of what Resonate is and where it's going. Synthesised from the
existing tool plus a survey of the field (00 Enclosure Simulator, SoundForm,
SpeakerDesign.dev, SpeakerBoxLite). This doubles as a backlog: if a ⬜ item
appeals, claim it in an issue.

**Legend:** ✅ done · 🔨 in progress · ⬜ planned · *“seen in X”* = demand already
proven by another tool.

## Tools surveyed

- **Resonate** *(this project)* — open source, MIT —
  <https://github.com/Johnlon/resonate>
- **00 Simulator** by *mbdavis* (00aud.io) — free, no login, closed source —
  <https://simulator.00aud.io/> · roadmap <https://simulator.00aud.io/roadmap> ·
  WinISD comparison <https://simulator.00aud.io/compare/winisd-vs-00-simulator>.
  The most developed of the field: ~65 shipped features, public voted roadmap,
  amplifier-load graph + interactive schematic view, on-graph parametric EQ +
  HP/LP + Linkwitz transform + shelves, imports **`.wdr` and `.wpr` and Unibox**
  and **exports WinISD-compatible files**, and **shares designs by URL**.
  Notably, it *publicly commits to open-sourcing “if the project ever goes
  stale.”*
- **SoundForm** by *u/BusyEntrepreneur9636* — closed beta, access by DM —
  <https://www.reddit.com/r/diyaudio/comments/1snqre1/new_features_for_web_based_winisd_app/>
- **SpeakerDesign.dev** — 100% free, no login, closed source —
  <https://speakerdesign.dev/> — a deep suite: T/S Parameters (+ personal driver
  DB), a guided **Driver Wizard** (sealed presets; vented QB3/SBB4/EBS; bandpass/
  PR/ABC “coming”), a **Box Simulator** that nearly matches Resonate (transfer
  mag, excursion, port velocity, impedance, phase, group delay, max power, max
  SPL; full Ql/Qa/Qp losses; **1–4 vents, round or slot, selectable end-
  correction; drag-to-adjust Vb/Fb with locking; frequency presets; listening
  distance**), a detailed **Box Calculator** (6 assembly cases, driver/port
  displacement, bracing, lining, component volumes, cutlist), a polished
  **Cutlist Optimizer** (bin-packing, kerf, rotate, fractional inches, PDF), and
  an open **knowledge base + tutorial**. Sealed/vented only (no bandpass/PR/`.wdr`
  yet), but broader than Resonate on vents, construction, and education.
- **SpeakerBoxLite** — established freemium / PAYG (web + iOS + Android), closed
  source — <https://speakerboxlite.com/> — the most feature-complete of the
  field: 5,000+ drivers, transmission line, full crossover suite, 3D builder,
  STL port export.

> A further r/diyaudio thread, *“I built a web-based WinISD”*

> their authors’ public posts, not independent testing.

- ✅ **Federated driver data** — `drivers/sources.json` links external `.wdr`
  repos; add one via PR, no re-hosting
- ⬜ **URL-encoded shareable designs** — paste a design as a link — *00 Simulator already ships this; table stakes, not a differentiator*

## 9. Learning & docs

## Honest competitive position

The field is far more advanced than “WinISD is dead” implies — and closer
inspection makes this *more* true, not less. **00 Simulator** is feature-rich,
polished, actively developed, and already does several things once imagined as
Resonate differentiators (WinISD-compatible export, URL design sharing, amp-load
graph, EQ chain). **SpeakerDesign.dev**’s simulator roughly matches Resonate’s
graph set and *exceeds* it on vents/ports, construction, and education.
**SpeakerBoxLite** is the broadest (transmission line, full crossover, 5,000+
drivers) but paywalled. On raw features Resonate is, at best, mid-pack — and
behind on construction/woodworking entirely.

So Resonate does **not** win on features today. Its genuine, defensible edge is
narrower and sharper:

- **Open source, now — not “if it goes stale.”** 00 Simulator *pledges* to open
  up someday; Resonate’s code is MIT and public today. A promise to open later is
  not an open project.
- **Open *data*, not just open code.** A community-owned, version-controlled
  driver commons that no single operator can wall off or take down. None of the
  closed tools open their aggregated driver data — and Resonate goes further by
  **federating**: it links to other people's `.wdr` repos rather than hoarding,
  so the commons grows without a central gatekeeper.
- **Provable physics.** Published validation against the closed-form solutions,
  re-checked in CI on every push. No competitor surveyed makes (let alone proves)
  this claim.
- **Truly ownerless longevity.** MIT + on disk in every clone = it cannot die or
  get paywalled. That’s a structural guarantee, not a maintainer’s good intentions.

## Where it needs to catch up
EQ chain, amplifier-load graph, datasheet→params paste, 6th-order bandpass, `.wpr`
import, richer vents (multi/slot/end-correction), series resistance + listening
distance, and construction output (volume calc, cut list, 3D). All tractable on
the existing engine — good first contributions.

## Strategic implication for the “unite” pitch
The honest framing isn’t “mine is better.” It’s: the best tools are closing up or
charging, and even the friendliest only *promises* to open up if it dies. Resonate
is the neutral, already-open foundation to pool effort and data into — so no one
has to trust a single operator’s goodwill. The ask to other authors stands, but
the hook is **open now + open data + provable**, not feature superiority.
